Sound Meter
===========
This is a web-based sound meter to measure sound levels and play an annoying noise when the sound levels are too high.

=========== 
1. Clone the repository
2. Start a web server in the repository directory (e.g. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`) 
3. Plug in your headphones to avoid feedback
4. Browse to `sound-meter.html` and click 'Start'
4. Make some loud noises and see what happens!

Dependencies
